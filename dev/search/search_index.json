This allows different projects/branches to use different PDM versions. To initialize a new or existing project , cd into the project folder and: Linux/Mac Windows 1 2 curl -LO https://github.com/pyprojectx/pyprojectx/releases/latest/download/wrappers.zip && unzip wrappers.zip && rm -f wrappers.zip ./pw --init pdm 1 2 Invoke-WebRequest https :// github . com / pyprojectx / pyprojectx / releases / latest / download / wrappers . zip -OutFile wrappers . zip ; Expand-Archive -Path wrappers . zip -DestinationPath .; Remove-Item -Path wrappers . zip .\\ pw - -init pdm Enable PEP 582 globally # To make the Python interpreters aware of PEP 582 packages, one need to add the pdm/pep582/sitecustomize.py to the Python library search path. For Windows users # One just needs to execute pdm --pep582 , then environment variable will be changed automatically. Don't forget to restart the terminal session to take effect. For Mac and Linux users # The command to change the environment variables can be printed by pdm --pep582 [<SHELL>] . If <SHELL> isn't given, PDM will pick one based on some guesses. You can run eval \"$(pdm --pep582)\" to execute the command. You may want to write a line in your .bash_profile (or similar profiles) to make it effective when logging in. For example, in bash you can do this: 1 pdm --pep582 >> ~/.bash_profile Once again, Don't forget to restart the terminal session to take effect. Shell Completion # PDM supports generating completion scripts for Bash, Zsh, Fish or Powershell. Here are some common locations for each shell: Bash Zsh Fish Powershell 1 pdm completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/pdm.bash-completion 1 2 # Make sure ~/.zfunc is added to fpath, before compinit. pdm completion zsh > ~/.zfunc/_pdm Oh-My-Zsh: 1 2 mkdir $ZSH_CUSTOM /plugins/pdm pdm completion zsh > $ZSH_CUSTOM /plugins/pdm/_pdm Then make sure pdm plugin is enabled in ~/.zshrc 1 pdm completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/pdm.fish 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # Create a directory to store completion scripts mkdir $PROFILE \\..\\ Completions echo @' Get-ChildItem \"$PROFILE\\..\\Completions\\\" | ForEach-Object { . $_.FullName } '@ | Out-File -Append -Encoding utf8 $PROFILE # Generate script Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser pdm completion powershell | Out-File -Encoding utf8 $PROFILE \\..\\ Completions \\ pdm_completion . ps1 Use with IDE # Now there are not built-in support or plugins for PEP 582 in most IDEs, you have to configure your tools manually. PDM will write and store project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml and you are recommended to add following lines in the .gitignore : 1 2 .pdm.toml __pypackages__/ PyCharm # Mark __pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib as Sources Root . Then, select as Python interpreter a Python installation with the same <major.minor> version. Additionally, if you want to use tools from the environment (e.g. pytest ), you have to add the __pypackages__/<major.minor>/bin directory to the PATH variable in the corresponding run/debug configuration. VSCode # Add the following two entries to the top-level dict in .vscode/settings.json : 1 2 3 4 { \"python.autoComplete.extraPaths\" : [ \"__pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib\" ], \"python.analysis.extraPaths\" : [ \"__pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib\" ] } Enable PEP582 globally , and make sure VSCode runs using the same user and shell you enabled PEP582 for. Cannot enable PEP582 globally? If for some reason you cannot enable PEP582 globally, you can still configure each \"launch\" in each project: set the PYTHONPATH environment variable in your launch configuration, in .vscode/launch.json . For example, to debug your pytest run: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 { \"version\" : \"0.2.0\" , \"configurations\" : [ { \"name\" : \"pytest\" , \"type\" : \"python\" , \"request\" : \"launch\" , \"module\" : \"pytest\" , \"args\" : [ \"tests\" ], \"justMyCode\" : false , \"env\" : { \"PYTHONPATH\" : \"__pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib\" } } ] } If your package resides in a src directory, add it to PYTHONPATH as well: 1 \"env\" : { \"PYTHONPATH\" : \"src:__pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib\" } Using Pylance/Pyright? If you have configured \"python.analysis.diagnosticMode\": \"workspace\" , and you see a ton of errors/warnings as a result. you may need to create pyrightconfig.json in the workspace directory, and fill in the following fields: 1 2 3 { \"exclude\" : [ \"__pypackages__\" ] } Then restart the language server or VS Code and you're good to go. In the future ( microsoft/pylance-release#1150 ), maybe the problem will be solved. Using Jupyter Notebook? If you wish to use pdm to install jupyter notebook and use it in vscode in conjunction with the python extension: Use pdm add notebook or so to install notebook Add a .env file inside of your project director with contents like the following: 1 PYTHONPATH=/your-workspace-path/__pypackages__/<major>.<minor>/lib If the above still doesn't work, it's most likely because the environment variable is not properly loaded when the Notebook starts. There are two workarounds. Run code . in Terminal. It will open a new VSCode window in the current directory with the path set correctly. Use the Jupyter Notebook in the new window If you prefer not to open a new window, run the following at the beginning of your Jupyter Notebook to explicitly set the path: 1 2 import sys sys.path.append('/your-workspace-path/__pypackages__/<major>.<minor>/lib') Reference Issue Task Provider # In addition, there is a VSCode Task Provider extension available for download. This makes it possible for VSCode to automatically detect pdm scripts so they can be run natively as VSCode Tasks . Neovim # If using neovim-lsp with pyright and want your __pypackages__ directory to be added to the path, you can add this to your project's pyproject.toml . 1 2 [tool.pyright] extraPaths = [ \"__pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib/\" ] Seek for other IDEs or editors # PDM Eco-system # Awesome PDM is a curated list of awesome PDM plugins and resources.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"PDM is a modern Python package manager with PEP 582 support.

Tips about developing a PDM plugin. # When developing a plugin, one hopes to activate and plugin in development and get updated when the code changes. This is usually done by pip install -e . or python setup.py develop in the traditional Python packaging world which leverages setup.py to do so. However, as there is no such setup.py in a PDM project, how can we do that? Fortunately, it becomes even easier with PDM and PEP 582. First, you should enable PEP 582 globally following the corresponding part of this doc . Then you just need to install all dependencies into the __pypackages__ directory by: 1 pdm install After that, all the dependencies are available with a compatible Python interpreter, including the plugin itself, in editable mode. That means any change to the codebase will take effect immediately without re-installation. The pdm executable also uses a Python interpreter under the hood, so if you run pdm from inside the plugin project, the plugin in development will be activated automatically, and you can do some testing to see how it works. That is how PEP 582 benefits our development workflow. Publish your plugin # Now you have defined your plugin already, let's distribute it to PyPI. PDM's plugins are discovered by entry point types. Create an pdm entry point and point to your plugin callable (yeah, it doesn't need to be a function, any callable object can work): PEP 621 : 1 2 3 4 # pyproject.toml [project.entry-points.pdm] hello = \"my_plugin:hello_plugin\" setuptools : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # setup.py setup ( ... entry_points = { \"pdm\" : [ \"hello = my_plugin:hello_plugin\" ]} ... ) Activate the plugin # As plugins are loaded via entry points, they can be activated with no more steps than just installing the plugin. For convenience, PDM provides a plugin command group to manage plugins. Assume your plugin is published as pdm-hello : 1 pdm plugin add pdm-hello Now type pdm --help in the terminal, you will see the new added hello command and use it: 1 2 $ pdm hello Jack Hello, Jack See more plugin management subcommands by typing pdm plugin --help in the terminal.","title":"Write a plugin"},{"location":"plugin/write/#write-a-plugin","text":"PDM is aiming at being a community driven package manager.

A build backend is what drives the build system to build source distributions and wheels from arbitrary source trees. pdm also ships with its own build backend, pdm-pep517 . Besides the PEP 621 project meta , it reads additional configurations stored in [tool.pdm.build] table to control the build behavior. To use it, include the following in your pyproject.toml (It will be done automatically if you use the pdm init or pdm import to create the file): 1 2 3 [build-system] requires = [ \"pdm-pep517\" ] build-backend = \"pdm.pep517.api\" Note The following part of this documentation assumes you are using the pdm-pep517 backend as mentioned above. Different backends will have different configurations. Dynamic versioning # pdm-pep517 supports dynamic versions from two sources. To enable dynamic versioning, remember to include version in the dynamic field of PEP 621 metadata: 1 2 3 [project] ... dynamic = [ \"version\" ] Dynamic version from file # 1 2 [tool.pdm] version = { source = \"file\" , path = \"mypackage/__version__.py\" } The backend will search for the pattern __version__ = \"{version}\" in the given file and use the value as the version. Tip Thanks to the TOML syntax, the above example is equivalent to the following: 1 2 3 [tool.pdm.version] source = \"file\" path = \"mypackage/__version__.py\" Or: 1 2 3 [tool.pdm] version . source = \"file\" version . path = \"mypackage/__version__.py\" Dynamic version from SCM # If you've used setuptools-scm you will be familiar with this approach. pdm-pep517 can also read the version from the tag of your SCM repository: 1 2 [tool.pdm] version = { source = \"scm\" } Specify the version manually # When building the package, pdm-pep517 will require the SCM to be available to populate the version. If that is not the case, you can still specify the version with an environment variable PDM_PEP517_SCM_VERSION : 1 2 export PDM_PEP517_SCM_VERSION = \"1.2.3\" pdm build Write the version to file # For dynamic version read from SCM, it would be helpful to write the evaluated value to a file when building a wheel, so that you do not need importlib.metadata to get the version in code. 1 2 3 4 [tool.pdm.version] source = \"scm\" write-to = \"mypackage/__version__.py\" write-template = \"__version__ = '{}'\" # optional, default to \"{}\" For source distributions, the version will be frozen and converted to a static version in the pyproject.toml file, which will be included in the distribution. Include and exclude files # To include extra files and/or exclude files from the distribution, give the paths in includes and excludes configuration, as glob patterns: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 [tool.pdm.build] includes = [ \"**/*.json\" , \"mypackage/\" , ] excludes = [ \"mypackage/_temp/*\" ] In case you may want some files to be included in source distributions only, use the source-includes field: 1 2 3 4 [tool.pdm.build] includes = [...] excludes = [...] source-includes = [ \"tests/\" ] Note that the files defined in source-includes will be excluded automatically from binary distributions. Default values for includes and excludes # If you don't specify any of these fields, PDM can determine the values for you to fit the most common workflows, in the following manners: Top-level packages will be included. tests package will be excluded from non-sdist builds. src directory will be detected as the package-dir if it exists. If your project follows the above conventions you don't need to config any of these fields and it just works. Be aware PDM won't add PEP 420 implicit namespace packages automatically and they should always be specified in includes explicitly. Select another package directory to look for packages # Similar to setuptools ' package_dir setting, one can specify another package directory, such as src , in pyproject.toml easily: 1 2 [tool.pdm.build] package-dir = \"src\" If no package directory is given, PDM can also recognize src as the package-dir implicitly if: src/__init__.py doesn't exist, meaning it is not a valid Python package, and There exist some packages under src/* . Implicit namespace packages # As specified in PEP 420 , a directory will be recognized as a namespace package if: <package>/__init__.py doesn't exist, and There exist normal packages and/or other namespace packages under <package>/* , and <package> is explicitly listed in includes Custom file generation # During the build, you may want to generate other files or download resources from the internet. You can achieve this by the setup-script build configuration: 1 2 [tool.pdm.build] setup-script = \" build . py In the build.py script, pdm-pep517 looks for a build function and calls it with two arguments: src : (str) the path to the source directory dst : (str) the path to the distribution directory Example: 1 2 3 4 5 # build.py def build ( src , dst ): target_file = os . path . join ( dst , \"mypackage/myfile.txt\" ) os . makedirs ( os . path . dirname ( target_file ), exist_ok = True ) download_file_to ( dst ) The generated file will be copied to the resulted wheel with the same hierarchy, you need to create the parent directories if necessary. Build Platform-specific Wheels # setup-script can also be used to build platform-specific wheels, such as C extensions. Currently, building C extensions still relies on setuptools . Set the run-setuptools to true under setup-script , and pdm-pep517 will generate a setup.py with the custom build function in the script and run python setup.py build to build extensions. In the build.py script, the expected build function receives the argument dictionary to be passed to the setup() call. In the function, you can update the dictionary with any additional or changed values as you want. Here is an example adapted to build MarkupSafe : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 # build.py from setuptools import Extension ext_modules = [ Extension ( \"markupsafe._speedups\" , [ \"src/markupsafe/_speedups.c\" ]) ] def build ( setup_kwargs ): setup_kwargs . update ( ext_modules = ext_modules ) The build configuration should look like: 1 2 3 4 # pyproject.toml [tool.pdm.build] setup-script = \"build.py\" run-setuptools = true If you run pdm build (or any other build frontends such as build ), PDM will build a platform-specific wheel file as well as a sdist. By default, every build is performed in a clean and isolated environment, only build requirements can be seen. If your build has optional requirements that depend on the project environment, you can turn off the environment isolation by pdm build --no-isolation or setting config build_isolation to falsey value. Override the \"Is-Purelib\" value # Sometimes you may want to build platform-specific wheels but don't have a build script(the binaries may be built or fetched by other tools). In this case you can set the is-purelib value in the pyproject.toml to false : 1 2 [tool.pdm.build] is-purelib = false If this value is not specified, pdm-pep517 will build platform-specific wheels if run-setuptools is true , therefore is-purelib is true in this case. Editable build backend # PDM implements PEP 660 to build wheels for editable installation. One can choose how to generate the wheel out of the two methods: path : (Default)The legacy method used by setuptools that create .pth files under the packages path. editables : Create proxy modules under the packages path. Since the proxy module is looked for at runtime, it may not work with some static analysis tools. Read the PEP for the difference of the two methods and how they work. Specify the method in pyproject.toml like below: 1 2 [tool.pdm.build] editable-backend = \"path\" editables backend is more recommended but there is a known limitation that it can't work with PEP 420 namespace packages. So you would need to change to path in that case. About Python 2 compatibility Due to the fact that the build backend for PDM managed projects requires Python>=3.6, you would not be able to install the current project if Python 2 is being used as the host interpreter.

PDM then will install dependencies from pdm lock into the virtualenv. In the dedicated venv you can directly run tools by pytest tests/ instead of pdm run pytest tests/ . You should also make sure you don't run pdm add/pdm remove/pdm update/pdm lock in the test commands, otherwise the pdm lock file will be modified unexpectedly. Additional dependencies can be supplied with the deps config. Besides, isolated_buid and passenv config should be set as the above example to make PDM work properly. To get rid of these constraints, there is a Tox plugin tox-pdm which can ease the usage. You can install it by 1 pip install tox-pdm Or, 1 pdm add --dev tox-pdm And you can make the tox.ini much tidier as following, : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 [tox] env_list = py{36,37,38},lint [testenv] groups = dev commands = pytest tests [testenv:lint] groups = lint commands = flake8 src/ See the project's README for a detailed guidance. Use Nox as the runner # Nox is another great tool for automated testing. Unlike tox, Nox uses a standard Python file for configuration. It is much easier to use PDM in Nox, here is an example of noxfile.py : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 import os import nox os . environ . update ({ \"PDM_IGNORE_SAVED_PYTHON\" : \"1\" }) @nox . session def tests ( session ): session . run ( 'pdm' , 'install' , '-G' , 'test' , external = True ) session . run ( 'pytest' ) @nox . session def lint ( session ): session . run ( 'pdm' , 'install' , '-G' , 'lint' , external = True ) session . run ( 'flake8' , '--import-order-style' , 'google' ) Note that PDM_IGNORE_SAVED_PYTHON should be set so that PDM can pick up the Python in the virtualenv correctly. Also make sure pdm is available in the PATH . Before running nox, you should also pdm config use_venv true to enable venv reusing. About PEP 582 __pypackages__ directory # By default, if you run tools by pdm run , __pypackages__ will be seen by the program and all subprocesses created by it. This means virtual environments created by those tools are also aware of the packages inside __pypackages__ , which result in unexpected behavior in some cases. For nox , you can avoid this by adding a line in noxfile.py : 1 os . environ . pop ( \"PYTHONPATH\" , None ) For tox , PYTHONPATH will not be passed to the test sessions so this isn't going to be a problem. Moreover, it is recommended to make nox and tox live in their own pipx environments so you don't need to install for every project. In this case, PEP 582 packages will not be a problem either. Use PDM in Continuous Integration # Only one thing to keep in mind -- PDM can't be installed on Python < 3.7, so if your project is to be tested on those Python versions, you have to make sure PDM is installed on the correct Python version, which can be different from the target Python version the particular job/task is run on. Fortunately, if you are using GitHub Action, there is pdm-project/setup-pdm to make this process easier. Here is an example workflow of GitHub Actions, while you can adapt it for other CI platforms. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Testing : runs-on : ${{ matrix.os }} strategy : matrix : python-version : [ 3.7 , 3.8 , 3.9 , \"3.10\" ] os : [ ubuntu-latest , macOS-latest , windows-latest ] steps : - uses : actions/checkout@v1 - name : Set up PDM uses : pdm-project/setup-pdm@main with : python-version : ${{ matrix.python-version }} - name : Install dependencies run : | pdm sync -d -G testing - name : Run Tests run : | pdm run -v pytest tests TIPS For GitHub Action users, there is a known compatibility issue on Ubuntu virtual environment. If PDM parallel install is failed on that machine you should either set parallel_install to false or set env LD_PRELOAD=/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1 .

You should also make sure you don't run pdm add/pdm remove/pdm update/pdm lock in the test commands, otherwise the pdm lock file will be modified unexpectedly. Additional dependencies can be supplied with the deps config. Besides, isolated_buid and passenv config should be set as the above example to make PDM work properly. To get rid of these constraints, there is a Tox plugin tox-pdm which can ease the usage.

For nox , you can avoid this by adding a line in noxfile.py : 1 os . environ . pop ( \"PYTHONPATH\" , None ) For tox , PYTHONPATH will not be passed to the test sessions so this isn't going to be a problem. Moreover, it is recommended to make nox and tox live in their own pipx environments so you don't need to install for every project.

Add dependencies # 1 pdm add requests pdm add can be followed by one or several dependencies, and the dependency specification is described in PEP 508 . PDM also allows extra dependency groups by providing -G/--group <name> option, and those dependencies will go to [project.optional-dependencies.<name>] table in the project file, respectively. After that, dependencies and sub-dependencies will be resolved properly and installed for you, you can view pdm.lock to see the resolved result of all dependencies. Local dependencies # Local packages can be added with their paths. The path can be a file or a directory: 1 2 pdm add ./sub-package pdm add ./first-1.0.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl The paths MUST start with a . , otherwise it will be recognized as a normal named requirement. VCS dependencies # You can also install from a git repository url or other version control systems. The following are supported: Git: git Mercurial: hg Subversion: svn Bazaar: bzr The URL should be like: {vcs}+{url}@{rev} Examples: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 # Install pip repo on tag `22.0` pdm add \"git+https://github.com/pypa/pip.git@22.0\" # Provide credentials in the URL pdm add \"git+https://username:password@github.com/username/private-repo.git@master\" # Give a name to the dependency pdm add \"pip @ git+https://github.com/pypa/pip.git@22.0\" # Or use the #egg fragment pdm add \"git+https://github.com/pypa/pip.git@22.0#egg=pip\" Add development only dependencies # New in 1.5.0 PDM also supports defining groups of dependencies that are useful for development, e.g. some for testing and others for linting. We usually don't want these dependencies appear in the distribution's metadata so using optional-dependencies is probably not a good idea. We can define them as development dependencies: 1 pdm add -dG test pytest This will result in a pyproject.toml as following: 1 2 [tool.pdm.dev-dependencies] test = [ \"pytest\" ] For backward-compatibility, if only -d or --dev is specified, dependencies will go to dev group under [tool.pdm.dev-dependencies] by default. Note The same group name MUST NOT appear in both [tool.pdm.dev-dependencies] and [project.optional-dependencies] . Editable dependencies # Local directories and VCS dependencies can be installed in editable mode . If you are familiar with pip , it is just like pip install -e <package> . Editable packages are allowed only in development dependencies : 1 2 3 4 5 6 # A relative path to the directory pdm add -e ./sub-package # A file URL to a local directory pdm add -e file:///path/to/sub-package # A VCS URL pdm add -e git+https://github.com/pallets/click.git@main#egg = click Save version specifiers # If the package is given without a version specifier like pdm add requests . PDM provides three different behaviors of what version specifier is saved for the dependency, which is given by --save-<strategy> (Assume 2.21.0 is the latest version that can be found for the dependency): minimum : Save the minimum version specifier: >=2.21.0 (default). compatible : Save the compatible version specifier: >=2.21.0,<3.0.0 . exact : Save the exact version specifier: ==2.21.0 . wildcard : Don't constrain version and leave the specifier to be wildcard: * . Add prereleases # One can give --pre/--prerelease option to pdm add so that prereleases are allowed to be pinned for the given packages. Update existing dependencies # To update all dependencies in the lock file: 1 pdm update To update the specified package(s): 1 pdm update requests To update multiple groups of dependencies: 1 pdm update -G security -G http To update a given package in the specified group: 1 pdm update -G security cryptography If the group is not given, PDM will search for the requirement in the default dependencies set and raises an error if none is found. To update packages in development dependencies: 1 2 3 4 # Update all default + dev-dependencies pdm update -d # Update a package in the specified group of dev-dependencies pdm update -dG test pytest About update strategy # Similarly, PDM also provides 2 different behaviors of updating dependencies and sub-dependencies\uff0c which is given by --update-<strategy> option: reuse : Keep all locked dependencies except for those given in the command line (default). eager : Try to lock a newer version of the packages in command line and their recursive sub-dependencies and keep other dependencies as they are. all : Update all dependencies and sub-dependencies. Update packages to the versions that break the version specifiers # One can give -u/--unconstrained to tell PDM to ignore the version specifiers in the pyproject.toml . This works similarly to the yarn upgrade -L/--latest command. Besides, pdm update also supports the --pre/--prerelease option. Remove existing dependencies # To remove existing dependencies from project file and the library directory: 1 2 3 4 5 6 # Remove requests from the default dependencies pdm remove requests # Remove h11 from the 'web' group of optional-dependencies pdm remove -G web h11 # Remove pytest-cov from the `test` group of dev-dependencies pdm remove -dG test pytest-cov Install the packages pinned in lock file # There are two similar commands to do this job with a slight difference: pdm install will check the lock file and relock if it mismatches with project file, then install. pdm update installs dependencies in the lock file and will error out if it doesn't exist. Besides, pdm sync can also remove unneeded packages if --clean option is given. Specify the lockfile to use # You can specify another lockfile than the default pdm lock by using the -L/--lockfilie <filepath> option or the PDM_LOCKFILE environment variable. Select a subset of dependencies with CLI options # Say we have a project with following dependencies: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 [ project ] # This is production dependencies dependencies = [ \"requests\" ] [ project . optional-dependencies ] # This is optional dependencies extra1 = [ \"flask\" ] extra2 = [ \"django\" ] [ tool . pdm . dev-dependencies ] # This is dev dependencies dev1 = [ \"pytest\" ] dev2 = [ \"mkdocs\" ] Command What it does Comments pdm install install prod and dev deps (no optional) pdm install -G extra1 install prod deps, dev deps, and \"extra1\" optional group pdm install -G dev1 install prod deps and only \"dev1\" dev group pdm install -G:all install prod deps, dev deps and \"extra1\", \"extra2\" optional groups pdm install -G extra1 -G dev1 install prod deps, \"extra1\" optional group and only \"dev1\" dev group pdm install --prod install prod only pdm install --prod -G extra1 install prod deps and \"extra1\" optional pdm install --prod -G dev1 Fail, --prod can't be given with dev dependencies Leave the --prod option All development dependencies are included as long as --prod is not passed and -G doesn't specify any dev groups. Besides, if you don't want the root project to be installed, add --no-self option, and --no-editable can be used when you want all packages to be installed in non-editable versions. With --no-editable turn on, you can safely archive the whole __pypackages__ and copy it to the target environment for deployment. Show what packages are installed # Similar to pip list , you can list all packages installed in the packages directory: 1 pdm list Or show a dependency graph by: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 $ pdm list --graph tempenv 0.0.0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 click 7.0 [ required: <7.0.0,>=6.7 ] black 19.10b0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 appdirs 1.4.3 [ required: Any ] \u251c\u2500\u2500 attrs 19.3.0 [ required: >=18.1.0 ] \u251c\u2500\u2500 click 7.0 [ required: >=6.5 ] \u251c\u2500\u2500 pathspec 0.7.0 [ required: <1,>=0.6 ] \u251c\u2500\u2500 regex 2020.2.20 [ required: Any ] \u251c\u2500\u2500 toml 0.10.0 [ required: >=0.9.4 ] \u2514\u2500\u2500 typed-ast 1.4.1 [ required: >=1.4.0 ] bump2version 1.0.0 Set PyPI index URL # You can specify a PyPI mirror URL by following commands: 1 pdm config pypi.url https://test.pypi.org/simple By default, PDM will read the pip's configuration files to decide the PyPI URL, and fallback to https://pypi.org/simple if none is found. Allow prerelease versions to be installed # Include the following setting in pyproject.toml to enable: 1 2 [tool.pdm] allow_prereleases = true Set acceptable format for locking or installing # If you want to control the format(binary/sdist) of the packages, you can set the env vars PDM_NO_BINARY and PDM_ONLY_BINARY . Each env var is a comma-separated list of package name. You can set it to :all: to apply to all packages. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 # No binary for werkzeug will be locked nor used for installation PDM_NO_BINARY=werkzeug pdm add flask # Only binaries will be locked in the lock file PDM_ONLY_BINARY=:all: pdm lock # No binaries will be used for installation PDM_NO_BINARY=:all: pdm install Solve the locking failure # If PDM is not able to find a resolution to satisfy the requirements, it will raise an error. For example, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 pdm django == 3 .1.4 \"asgiref<3\" ... \ud83d\udd12 Lock failed Unable to find a resolution for asgiref because of the following conflicts: asgiref< 3 ( from project ) asgiref< 4 ,> = 3 .2.10 ( from <Candidate django 3 .1.4 from https://pypi.org/simple/django/> ) To fix this, you could loosen the dependency version constraints in pyproject.toml. If that is not possible, you could also override the resolved version in [ tool.pdm.overrides ] table. You can either change to a lower version of django or remove the upper bound of asgiref . But if it is not eligible for your project, you can tell PDM to forcedly resolve asgiref to a specific version by adding the following lines to pyproject.toml : New in version 1.12.0 1 2 3 4 [tool.pdm.overrides] asgiref = \"3.2.10\" # exact version urllib3 = \">=1.26.2\" # version range pytz = \"file:///${PROJECT_ROOT}/pytz-2020.9-py3-none-any.whl\" # absolute URL Each entry of that table is a package name with the wanted version. In this example, PDM will resolve the above packages into the given versions no matter whether there is any other resolution available. Note By using [tool.pdm.overrides] setting, you are at your own risk of any incompatibilities from that resolution. It can only be used if there is no valid resolution for your requirements and you know the specific version works. Most of the time, you can just add any transient constraints to the dependencies array. Environment variables expansion # For convenience, PDM supports environment variables expansion in the dependency specification under some circumstances: Environment variables in the URL auth part will be expanded: https://${USERNAME}:${PASSWORD}/artifacts.io/Flask-1.1.2.tar.gz . It is also okay to not give the auth part in the URL directly, PDM will ask for them when -v/--verbose is on. ${PROJECT_ROOT} will be expanded with the absolute path of the project root, in POSIX style(i.e. forward slash / , even on Windows). For consistency, URLs that refer to a local path under ${PROJECT_ROOT} must start with file:/// (three slashes), e.g. file:///${PROJECT_ROOT}/artifacts/Flask-1.1.2.tar.gz . Don't worry about credential leakage, the environment variables will be expanded when needed and kept untouched in the lock file.","title":"Manage Dependencies"},{"location":"usage/dependency/#manage-dependencies","text":"PDM provides a bunch of handful commands to help manage your project and dependencies.

It is easy to do so with PDM, via -g/--global option which is supported by most subcommands. If the option is passed, <CONFIG_ROOT>/global-project will be used as the project directory, which is almost the same as normal project except that pyproject.toml will be created automatically for you and it doesn't support build features. The idea is taken from Haskell's stack . However, unlike stack , by default, PDM won't use global project automatically if a local project is not found. Users should pass -g/--global explicitly to activate it, since it is not very pleasing if packages go to a wrong place. But PDM also leave the decision to users, just set the config global_project.fallback to true . If you want global project to track another project file other than <CONFIG_ROOT>/global-project , you can provide the project path via -p/--project <path> option. CAUTION Be careful with remove and sync --clean commands when global project is used, because it may remove packages installed in your system Python. Working with a virtualenv # Although PDM enforces PEP 582 by default, it also allows users to install packages into the virtualenv. It is controlled by the configuration item python.use_venv . When it is set to True , PDM will use the virtualenv if: a virtualenv is already activated. any of venv , .venv , env is a valid virtualenv folder. Besides, when python.use_venv is on and the interpreter path given is a venv-like path, PDM will reuse that venv directory as well. For enhanced virtualenv support such as virtualenv management and auto-creation, please go for pdm-venv , which can be installed as a plugin. Import project metadata from existing project files # If you are already other package manager tools like Pipenv or Poetry, it is easy to migrate to PDM. PDM provides import command so that you don't have to initialize the project manually, it now supports: Pipenv's Pipfile Poetry's section in pyproject.toml Flit's section in pyproject.toml requirements.txt format used by pip setuptools setup.py Also, when you are executing pdm init or pdm install , PDM can auto-detect possible files to import if your PDM project has not been initialized yet. CAUTION Converting a setup.py will execute the file with the project interpreter. Make sure setuptools is installed with the interpreter and the setup.py is trusted. Export locked packages to alternative formats # You can also export pdm lock to other formats, to ease the CI flow or image building process. Currently, only requirements.txt and setup.py format is supported: 1 2 pdm export -o requirements.txt pdm export -f setuppy -o setup.py Hide the credentials from pyproject.toml # There are many times when we need to use sensitive information, such as login credentials for the PyPI server and username passwords for VCS repositories. We do not want to expose this information in pyproject.toml and upload it to git. PDM provides several methods to achieve this: User can give the auth information with environment variables which are encoded in the URL directly: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 [[tool.pdm.source]] url = \"http://${INDEX_USER}:${INDEX_PASSWD}@test.pypi.org/simple\" name = \"test\" verify_ssl = false [project] dependencies = [ \"mypackage @ git+http://${VCS_USER}:${VCS_PASSWD}@test.git.com/test/mypackage.git@master\" ] Environment variables must be encoded in the form ${ENV_NAME} , other forms are not supported. Besides, only auth part will be expanded. If the credentials are not provided in the URL and a 401 response is received from the server, PDM will prompt for username and password when -v/--verbose is passed as command line argument, otherwise PDM will fail with an error telling users what happens. Users can then choose to store the credentials in the keyring after a confirmation question. A VCS repository applies the first method only, and an index server applies both methods. Manage caches # PDM provides a convenient command group to manage the cache, there are four kinds of caches: wheels/ stores the built results of non-wheel distributions and files. http/ stores the HTTP response content. metadata/ stores package metadata retrieved by the resolver. hashes/ stores the file hashes fetched from the package index or calculated locally. packages/ The centralized repository for installed wheels. See the current cache usage by typing pdm cache info . Besides, you can use add , remove and list subcommands to manage the cache content. Find the usage by the --help option of each command. How we make PEP 582 packages available to the Python interpreter # Thanks to the site packages loading on Python startup.
